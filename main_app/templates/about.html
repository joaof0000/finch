<h1>Welcome to the Finches</h1>
<hr />
<p>Welcome to the premier Finch Collector application!</p>
<p>
  Finches are small, colorful birds that are known for their beautiful songs.
  They are a part of the family Fringillidae, which includes over 300 species.
  Finches are found all over the world, but are most common in the Northern
  Hemisphere. They can be found in a variety of habitats, including forests,
  grasslands, and deserts.
</p>
<p>
  Finches are omnivores, meaning they eat both plants and animals. They
  primarily eat seeds, but will also eat insects, fruit, and nectar. Finches are
  social birds that live in flocks of up to 100 individuals. They are known for
  their beautiful songs, which they use to communicate with each other.

<h2>How to Use Finch Collector</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>Add Those Finches!</strong> - Get ready for a feathery frenzy!
    Choose colorful, chirpy finches and add them to your space. Remember,
    diversity's the key to a lively finch party.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Toy Time!</strong> - Finches love to play! From swings to bells, and
    mirrors to ladders, deck out their area with toys that'll keep them engaged
    and entertained. The funkier, the better!
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Data Collection (but make it fun!)</strong> - Grab a notepad, some
    stickers, and colorful pens. Start noting down their quirky behaviors,
    favorite toys, and even their unique chirps. Bonus: Create a finch
    leaderboard to see who's the most playful or the loudest singer.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Feeding Fiesta!</strong> - Finches get hangry (hungry + angry)!
    Ensure they've got a buffet of seeds, fruits, and treats. And watch out,
    they might just play with their food.
  </li>
